# ✈️ Flight Delay Prediction

Predicting flight delays using machine learning techniques on historical flight data. This project focuses on building a robust classification model that can predict whether a flight will be delayed based on multiple features such as departure time, airline, distance, and more.

## 📌 Project Overview

Flight delays are a major inconvenience for passengers and airlines. By analyzing past flight data, we can build predictive models to anticipate delays and help improve scheduling, logistics, and customer satisfaction.

This project involves:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Building and evaluating ML models
- Visualizing insights
